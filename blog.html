	<h2>This is my first Article</h2>
	<p id="one">A blog a truncation of the expression weblog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries posts. Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single.

	<p id="two">The author takes psychology studies that they come across (they happen to be a psychological researcher), and relates them to real world issues and in laymen’s terms, so that anyone can gain the information that they have to offer.</p>
     <p id="three">That’s the big emphasis I’d like to make on this blog: you should always be mindful of beginners, it’s not that you have to appeal only to beginners, but taking more complex information and boiling it down into something interesting that anyone can read is a formula for a winner, as long as the audience is there.</p>
